# SDL2 VGA Terminal 

| Windows |
|---------|
|[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/67mildjynhnlekk5?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Raffaello/sdl2-vga-terminal)|

It is an emulation of the VGA terminal using SDL2.

the VGA fonts are related to a `vgabios` project (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/vgabios/).

At the moment support only mode 3.

It should be on 16 colors in the classic way, but can support more thanks to SDL2.

It is just a matter of fonts and a terminal grid for displaying texts.


## Compiling

Use `vcpkg` and install `SDL2`.

## Usage

SDL2 Video sub-system has to be initialized before using `VgaTerminal` class.

for extended ASCII chars to use as literal (eg: char 205), it is required to save the source code with 
the codepage 437 encoding (OEM United States / Extended ASCII / DOS Terminal).


There is a demo usage as part of this cmake compilation too.


## Screenshot

This screenshot is also used in the snapshot test.

## Testing

using `GTest` framework.

There is a technique, snapshot testing, to verify some expectation, due to some required raster image to compare with,
there is a `boolean` option `TEST_DUMP_SNAPSHOT`, that will run the test suit for generating the expected result.
It could be a little bit risky, but it is a way to have generated expected results for the test suite.

The test suite take advantages of the option and will be compiled accordingly based on "dumping" or "testing".

please note if you are dumping the snapshot, you have to copy back to the `test/snapshot` directory to make the usable.

The filename generate are based on the test that are running, ideally: `[Test-suite.Test-name].png`

but doesn't really matter can be used any name, it all depends how the test is written of course.

## TODO 

Some must and ides:

- CI with Azure Devops, travis, appveyor, sonarcloud lgtm, etc... 
- decouple vga modes
- DAC Palette changing
- Cursor display
- doxygen / document the code
- use streams 
- read
